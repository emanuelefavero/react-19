      <h1>useFormStatus</h1>

      <p className='mb-2'>
        useFormStatus can be used to get the pending state of the submitted
        form. This pending state can be used for instance to disable the submit
        button or show a loading spinner.
      </p>

      <Example1 />
    </>
  )
}

/*
TIP:
While useActionState has a built-in pending status, useFormStatus is useful on its own when:

- There is no form state
- Creating shared form components
- There are multiple forms on the same pageâ€”useFormStatus will only return status information for a parent form
